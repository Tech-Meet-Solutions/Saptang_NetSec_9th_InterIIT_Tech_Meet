- Bug Overview: When running Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.79 on Windows with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the read-only initialisation parameter of the Default to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server. That could lead to remote code execution on the server.
- Aim: Write a working exploit for this CVE by which you can achieve RCE on local VM/Docker.
- Install vulnerable service in a VM/Docker and ensure to meet the condition so that you can exploit it.
- Run your exploit on the vulnerable service and make a video of it.
- Write a brief report about this bug including your exploit code and link for exploit and Video proof.
